# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on analyzing and predicting employee attrition within an organization. By leveraging machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project aims to uncover key factors that contribute to employee turnover and build predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving.

# Project Structure
\n**HR Employee Attrition.ipynb:** The main Jupyter notebook that documents the entire workflow, including:
\n**Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, and encoding categorical features.
\n**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization techniques such as count plots, violin plots, line plots, and heatmaps are used to explore the data and identify patterns related to employee attrition.
\n**Model Development:** Building and tuning various machine learning models to predict employee attrition. This includes feature scaling, model selection, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
\n**Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics, along with checking for overfitting or underfitting, to ensure reliable predictions.

# Visualizations
The project includes a variety of visualizations that highlight the relationships between different factors and employee attrition, helping to derive actionable insights.
